          <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>During my freetime, I enjoy playing video games.
              Below is a list of my favorite games as well as a
              brief description of what each game is about.</p>

          <h3>Valorant</h3>
            <p>Valorant is a tactical 5v5 shooter game in which two teams
              compete to win rounds. The final winner is the first to reach 13
              rounds. I enjoy playing this game because of the competitve mode
              it offers in which I can rank worldwide against other players.</p>

          <h3>Rocket League</h3>
          <p>Rocket League is essentially a car soccer game that offers multiple
          modes but mainly a 2v2 or 3v3 mode. The game works the same as a regular
          soccer game, in which two teams have a 5 minute time limit to score as
          many goals as possible.</p>
